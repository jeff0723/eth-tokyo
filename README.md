# PKP x Google x Safe ðŸª¢

This is an example web app that shows how you can mint and use programmable key pairs (PKPs) with just Google account. Furthermore, you can use this PKP with our customize wallet adater to connect with safe. With all these connectivity, you can create a Safe with PKP wallet and Sign a Safe transaction. In the future, we will even support the PKP wallet created by WebAuthn so anyone can use FaceID to create a Safe.
